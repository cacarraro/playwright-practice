# playwright-practice
Practice testing with playwright tool and python/pytest.
I have a background on test automation and experience in building ui automation framework, the goal here is to learn playwright and practice testing with this tool.

## To Install Playwright
https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

## Microsoft get started "exercises":
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-with-playwright/
- On /microsoft_exercises I used the given example on the playwright documentation to explore what is - presented in the microsoft learn page.
- The goal was to explore playwright and search for how to do the basics using python, with that I have a better understanding of what I can try out in the study projects to come.
- I learned a bit about enviroment configuration in python, how to get screenshots and that the tests can easily be adapted to run in a mobile emulation.
- To execute the tests go to microsoft_exercises path and run the pytest (python.exe -m pytest on windows)
